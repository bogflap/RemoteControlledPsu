[Identification]
ConfigurationId=Hakadi_SodiumIon_4S_18650_1500mA

[Timings]
; Maximum charging period in units of milliseconds.
; If the charging time period is exceeded then the charging
; cycle will be automatically terminated.
MaxChargePeriod=48000000
; Charging cycle monitoring period in units of milliseconds.
; This is the time period over which checks on the PSU actual
; voltages and currents are obtained and the charging algorithm
; applied. It is also the the time period when the main window
; is updated with the actual values obtained.
UpdatePeriod=1000

[Voltages]
; The maximum applied voltage in units of millivolts. This is
; the maximum voltage that can be applied during the constant
; current, constant voltage or initialisation modes of charging.
MaxAppliedVolts=16400
; The minimum applied voltage in units of millivolts. This is
; the minimum voltage that can be applied during the
; constant current, constant voltage or initialisation modes of
; charging.
MinAppliedVolts=1500

[Currents]
; The maximum constant current in units of milliamps. This
; is the maximum current allowed when charging in the constant
; current mode.
MaxConstantCurrent=750
; The maximum charge current in units of milliamps. This is
; the maximum current allowed when charging. Reaching or
; exceeding this value causes the charging cycle to terminate
; with an error.
MaxChargeCurrent=1000
; The completed current in units of milliamps. This is the
; current when charging in the constant voltage mode and is
; used to indicate when charging is complete.
CompletedCurrent=75

[Increments]
Voltage increments in units of millivolts. This is the
; voltage increment used when it is required to keep the
; charging current within the limits as determined by the
; maximum charge constant current and completed charge current
; parameters.
VoltsIncrement=12
